Other eligibility criteria also apply, for example, with respect to citizenship, immigration status and residency. Note that this table reflects the principal but not all MAGI coverage groups.

In addition, in states that are adopting the Medicaid expansion, we have indicated the upper income limit for parents to also be 133% of the FPL, since parents can be eligible for coverage under the new adult group. The actual dollar standards that states will use to determine eligibility are quoted in the monthly income tables."
